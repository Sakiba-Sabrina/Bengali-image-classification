## Bengali Numeric Character Image Classification

This project contains my source code of benglai character clasification. Just like english numbers, we have bengali numbers. In this project, I have classified ten Bengali numbers.

#### Technology Used
 -  Python
 -  Keras
 -  OpenCV
 
The dataset was collected from the internet as a csv file. The file contains the pixel value for every image. Every image contains a atleast one character.

I use CNN to classify the the images and check the accuracy and then try to plot the feature maps.
